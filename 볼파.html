<strong><u>Ball Python</u></strong>
<p>The ball python (Python regius), also called the royal python,
  is a python species native to West and Central Africa,
  where it lives in grasslands and shrublands.
  It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution.
  It is threatened by hunting for its meat and for the international pet trade.
  This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of 182 cm (72 in).
  The name 'ball python' refers to its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.</p>
    <strong><u>Taxonomy</u></strong>
  <p>Boa regia was the scientific name proposed by George Shaw in 1802 for a pale variegated python from an indistinct place in Africa.
    The generic name Python was proposed by François Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes.
     Between 1830 and 1849, several generic names were proposed for the same zoological specimen described by Shaw,
     including Enygrus by Johann Georg Wagler, Cenchris and Hertulia by John Edward Gray.
     Gray also described four specimens that were collected in Gambia and were preserved in spirits and fluid.</p>
